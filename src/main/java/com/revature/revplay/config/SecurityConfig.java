         * 1. It creates a 'Bean' so Spring can inject this encoder wherever passwords
         * need processing.
         * 2. It uses BCrypt, which is a strong, industry-standard 'hashing' function.
         * 3. Hashing is a one-way process; we never store plain-text passwords in the
         * database.
         * 4. When a user logs in, their input is hashed and compared to the hash in our
         * records.
         * 5. This protects user accounts even if the database were somehow compromised.

         * 1. CSRF Protection: Temporarily disabled to simplify development and API
         * interactions.
         * 2. Public Access: Essential pages like Login, Register, and static assets
         * (CSS/JS) are open to all.
         * 3. Role-Based Access: Specific folders like '/artist/' are strictly locked to
         * users with the 'ARTIST' role.
         * 4. Authenticated Request: Any page not explicitly made public requires a
         * valid user session.
         * 5. Custom Login: We define our own login page and where to go after a
         * successful entry.
         * 6. Logout Handling: A standardized way for users to end their secure
         * sessions.
         * 7. Error Handling: Redirecting users to a custom 403 Access Denied page if
         * they lack permission.
