## 📝 Technical Notes & Polish

- **Performance:** Replaced external Google Fonts with system-standard **Trebuchet MS** to eliminate blocking CDN requests and improve load times.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented a **Global Exception Handling** system with custom exceptions (`ResourceNotFoundException`, `UserAlreadyExistsException`, `InvalidFileException`) and a thematic error return page.
- **Code Health:** Performed a full project refactor, removing unused CSS, dead directory structures, and orphaned service methods.
- **UI Consistency:** Custom-styled all form elements (dropdowns, inputs) with an orange/snow design system, ensuring a premium "wow" factor across all pages.
- **Data URIs:** Profile and banner images are served as Base64 Data URIs directly from the Oracle BLOB store to minimize complex file system management.
- **Security:** Spring Security 6 integration using modern lambda-based DSL and role-based access control.
